ABOUT
-----

This is JL yuvutils version 1.0.  It includes three small utility
programs for processing YUV4MPEG video streams as produced and consumed
by the tools included in the MJPEG tools package[1].

I implemented these utilities to enhance some poor quality home videos
and to convert them into PAL frame rate.  I do not have any real
experience on video processing so be warned that I am probably doing lot
of things wrong with these utilities.  However, these utilities made it
possible for me to easily improve the quality of my home videos (as part
of automated scripted preprocessing before authoring them into a DVD) so
I was thinking someone else might find them useful too.

Let me shortly introduce the included programs.

yuvinfo
  displays information about YUV4MPEG streams. Optionally also produces
  YUV histograms and inserts them into the video stream as overlays.

yuvadjust
  automatically adjusts luminance level, contrast and white balance of
  YUV4MPEG streams.  Luminance and colors are adjusted based on the gray
  world assumption (i.e. assuming the content is 50% gray on average).
  This can be used to enhance poor quality video material such as too dark
  or reddish/blueish video.  It probably does more harm than good on high
  quality material, though.
  
yuvresample
  resamples a video stream for a different frame rate, optionally
  changing the interlacing mode as well.  Yuvresample does not simply
  drop or duplicate input frames like yuvfps from the MJPEG tools
  package does.  It produces output frames or fields using the weighted
  average of the two temporally closest input frames or fields.  This
  eliminates much of the visible stepping that occurs when frames are
  dropped or duplicated.  The drawback is that fast moving objects get
  blurred.  However, I personally prefer the output of yuvresample when
  downsampling videos from 30 FPS (my digital camera) to 25 FPS (PAL).
  Your mileage may vary.  This utility can also be used to create slow
  motion or speed up effects.

The latest version of this software can be obtained from JL yuvutils

BUILDING
--------

On a standard Linux system (and hopefully also on other Unix-like systems)
you should be able to build the software using the supplied Makefile
assuming you have MJPEG tools package[1] installed. This software was
developed against MJPEG tools version 1.8.0.

Build the software using:

  make
  
Optionally, you can also specify the path to MJPEG tools headers and the
mjpegutils library by giving make the following arguments:

  MJPEGTOOLS_INCLUDE_PATH=-I/somewhere/include/mjpegtools  
  MJPEGTOOLS_LIBMJPEGUTILS=/somewhere/lib/libmjpegutils.so
  
The default is to search for headers in /usr/local/include/mjpegtools
(in addition to the default include path) and to use -lmjpegutils for
the library.

The software can be installed either by manually copying the binaries
"yuvinfo", "yuvadjust" and "yuvresample" and the corresponding man
pages from the "man" subdirectory or by doing:

  make install
  
This will install the software under /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man.
You can change the installation location using the standard variables:

  prefix=<top-level prefix>
  exec_prefix=<top-level prefix for binaries>
  bindir=<directory for binaries>
  mandir=<directory for man pages>
  DESTDIR=<use this directory as the root directory>
